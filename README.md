# Pi Brooder

This is the backend code for a brooder control that can manage multiple temperature sensors and control light and power for multiple chicken brooders.
In this version the base hardware is a RaspberryPi, and it doesn't really matter which version. This was originally designed on a Version 1 Model B, but has since been running on a Version 3 Model B. It should also run on a Model A and quite possibly a Pi Zero.

Temperature sensors are the Dallas (now Maxim) 1-wire DS18B20. These can usually be picked up already encased and wired with a 1m lead from places like AliExpress for very little money.
